# **Weekly Report — Week 3**

**Period:** May 5–7, 2025
*(May 8–9 were public holidays.)*

## **Overview**

Five dedicated project sessions were held this week to advance the Bubble prototype. All Bubble training was completed in Week 2, so sessions focused solely on UI assembly and logic implementation.

## **Accomplishments**

* **Project Sessions (×5)**
  Conducted five focused sessions to build and iterate on the Bubble app.

* **Search & Filter Logic (Abderrazaq (Me))**

  * Live search implemented in the TopNavbar (filters Products by name).
  * Tag-based filtering completed in Favorites for Dish section only.

* **UI Implementation (Abderrazaq (Me))**

  * Favorites page scaffold: DishCards, WineCards, CheeseCards reusable elements placed with dynamic data.
  * Static layout for Recommendation page designed in Bubble.

* **Profile & Onboarding (Abderrazaq (Me))**

  * Profile page UI scaffolded with user preference controls; logic implementation pending.

* Onboarding flow wireframes drafted (language, diet, budget).

* **Technical Requirements Refined (Abderrazaq (Me))**

  * I finalized data type fields and naming conventions in Bubble.

## **Challenges**

* **Developer Availability**
  Pierre was present Monday only; core workflow integration postponed to next week.

* **Data Import Delay**
  No one volunteered to convert and import the client’s CSV into Bubble; this task must be assigned and completed before the presentation; scheduled for next sprint.

---

## **Plan for Next Week**

1. **Workflow Integration (Pierre)**

   * Pierre to connect search, favorites toggle, and recommendation logic within reusables.

2. **Recommendation Page (Pierre)**

   * Populate and test `recommended_wines`, `recommended_cheeses`, and `recommended_dishes` based on the clicked product.

3. **Data Import (Pierre)**

   * Import and validate the client’s product CSV in Bubble.

4. **Test Plan Draft (Evan)**

   * Draft test cases for search, navigation, favorites, and recommendation flows.

## **Conclusion**

The UI framework and core search/favorites logic are now implemented, though I handled the majority of design and development work independently. Team dynamics remain challenging, with significant absenteeism and lack of contribution from other members. Despite these obstacles, progress has been made on critical components. Next week's focus will shift to dynamic workflow integration and data import to drive a functional MVP, but clearer accountability and improved team participation will be essential for meeting project deadlines.
