# **Weekly Report — Week 4**

**Period:** May 12–16, 2025

## **Overview**

Week 4 was slower in terms of team productivity, as only three project work sessions were scheduled. The team dynamic remained low, likely due to academic fatigue and upcoming summer break. Despite that, progress continued in small increments.

## **Plan for Next Week**

1. **Product Page**
   - Create a dedicated page to view all products filtered by type (wine, cheese, dish).

2. **Tag System**
   - Display information widgets directly on product cards (cheese type, AOP, IGP).
   - Route clicks to filtered pages based on tag type
3. **Recommendation Page (Pierre)**
   * Create recommendation page.
   * Populate and test `recommended_wines`, `recommended_cheeses`, and `recommended_dishes` based on the clicked product.

## **Conclusion**

Although week 4 lacked momentum due to academic obligations and low engagement, essential progress was made in design polish and tag logic planning. A focused push will be needed in the coming week to resume full productivity ahead of the final presentation.
