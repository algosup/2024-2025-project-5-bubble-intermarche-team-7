# **Weekly Report — Week 2**

**Period:** April 28 – April 30, 2025
*(Note: May 1–2 were public holidays.)*

## **Overview**

This week we continued our Bubble training most mornings; only two dedicated project sessions took place. With Pierre largely absent, focus shifted to UI design, page layouts, and initial logic drafts in Bubble.

## **Accomplishments**

* **Design Completion Figma (Quentin, Abderrazaq)**
  Quentin and I finalized high‑fidelity designs for all screens: Home, Search, Recommendation, Favorites, Profile, Onboarding.

* **Bubble Page Layouts (Abderrazaq)**

  * **Navigation Bars**: built and styled TopNavbar & BottomNavbar reusable elements.
  * **Home Page**: implemented header (topNavbar), footer (bottomNavbar), category card grid.
  * **Favorites Page**: placed three reusable elements (dishCards, wineCards, cheeseCards) in a horizontal layout.

* **Static Components (Abderrazaq)**

  * Category cards on Home (image + label) in place.
  * Product cards rendered correctly (static data) in Favorites and Home.

* **Technical Requirements Draft (Manech)**

  * Manech began drafting the technical requirements document, establishing data types and naming conventions for the no-code Bubble implementation.

## **Challenges**

* **Developer Availability**
  Pierre was absent much of the week, delaying workflow and search logic implementation.

* **Search Logic Pending**
  SearchBox in TopNavbar and language toggle are styled but their dynamic filter workflow is not yet configured.

* **Testing Resources**
  Evan spent time on unrelated tasks; the Test Plan draft remains incomplete.

## **Plan for Next Week**

1. **Implement Search Workflow (Pierre)**

   * Configure SearchBox to filter `Products` by name in real time.
2. **Logic Integration (Pierre)**

   * Finish workflows for adding/removing favorites and filtering by tags.
3. **Test Plan Draft (Evan)**

   * Evan to draft test cases for search, favorites, and navigation.
4. **Recommendation Logic (Pierre)**

   * Wire up Recommendation page to pull `recommended_*` lists and display them.
5. **One‑on‑one Check‑in (All team members)**

   * Ensure all team members have clear tasks and deadlines.

## **Conclusion**

Despite limited sessions and holidays, we advanced the app’s UI structure and Bubble data schema. Next week’s focus will be on workflow implementation and test‐case preparation to push toward a functional MVP.
