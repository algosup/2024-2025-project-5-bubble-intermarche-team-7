# **Weekly Report — Week 5**

**Period:** May 19–23, 2025

## **Overview**

Week 5 marked the start of interactive logic development in Bubble. Significant progress was made on dynamic filtering and the recommendation engine. Additional test data was added to better simulate real user interactions.

## **Accomplishments**

* **Filter Tags (Abderrazaq)**

  * Implemented custom tag logic for dishes (by main meat), wines (by color), and cheeses (by type).
  * Integrated tag filters into the Favorites page UI (dish tag logic is fully functional).

* **Onboarding Pages**

  * Built onboarding flow to capture language and preference selections.
  * Linked top navbar language dropdown for FR/EN switching.

* **Recommendation Page**

  * Developed a dynamic recommendation system: viewing a dish displays paired wines and cheeses.
  * The system also supports reverse recommendations (from a wine or cheese), designed to allow infinite chaining for immersive browsing.

* **Test Data & Debugging**

  * Added one dish, one wine, and one cheese to test the full recommendation loop.

## **Challenges**

* **Testing & Realism**

  * Progress is still constrained by limited and placeholder test data.

## **Plan for Next Week**

1. **Complete Tag Filtering for Wine & Cheese**

   * Extend the current filtering logic to support all product types.

2. **Finalize Search Result Page**

   * Design a global search results layout with tag and keyword filtering.

3. **Implement Translations**

   * Use the Localize plugin to handle multilingual support.

## **Conclusion**

Week 5 established key foundations for user interaction through filtering, onboarding, and smart recommendations. The structure is now in place for broader content expansion and refinement.
