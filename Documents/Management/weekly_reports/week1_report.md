# **Weekly Report — Week 1**

**Period:** April 22 – April 25, 2025
*(Note: April 21 was public holiday.)*

## **Overview**

This week marked the launch of our Intermarché pairing app project. We kicked off with client alignment and laid the groundwork for design and data modeling. Due to concurrent Bubble training sessions, coding progress was minimal, focusing instead on planning and specification.

## **Accomplishments**

* **Client Kick‑off Meeting**
  Aligned with the client on core user flows for an app where users start with a dish to find optimal wine & cheese pairings and designed with profitability in mind.

* **Requirements & Data Draft (All team)**
  Defined page structure and sketched initial data types (Products shared across dishes, wines, cheeses).

* **Bubble Training**
  In progress a professional‑led tutorial to onboard the team on no‑code development practices.

* **Design & Mock‑ups**
  Created Figma draft wireframes.

* **Functional Specification Draft**
  Outlined key features.

## **Challenges**

* **No‑code Learning Curve**
  Team members adjusted to Bubble.io in parallel with spec work, limiting hands‑on development time.

* **Time Constraints**
  Only two weeks of course time were allocated; all setup and planning had to share the same window.

## **Plan for Next Week**

1. **Progress Functional Specs (Quentin)**
   Incorporate client feedback.

2. **Data Modeling in Bubble (Manech)**
   Implement the Products type, option sets (ProductType, DishCategory, TasteProfile, etc.), and the User.favorites field.

3. **Component Development (Abderrazaq (Me))**
   Build and test TopNavbar and BottomNavbar as reusable elements.

4. **Begin UI Implementation (Abderrazaq (Me))**
   Develop product cards (dishCards, wineCards, cheeseCards) and integrate search/filter logic.

## **Conclusion**

The foundational week established clear direction and ensured the team is ready to dive into Bubble development, with specs and designs in place to accelerate upcoming sprints.
